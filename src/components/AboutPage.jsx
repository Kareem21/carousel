                            In 1972 Charlotte H. Dinger, paid a chance visit to a Philadelphia
                            antiques shop, and walked out with the foundation of an unlikely
                            collection, and an even less likely career. She came to be known as
                            one of the worlds leading collectors, and foremost authorities on
                            antique carousels and carousel art. To hear her tell her story in
                            later years, Mrs. Dinger had two transforming experiences in her
                            life. The first occurred during a childhood visit to the old Olympic
                            Park in Maplewood, NJ. She became so enchanted with the
                            flamboyantly beautiful wooden horses, whirling around on the
                            amusement parks carousel. She promptly announced to her
                            parents that she wanted one of her own! Charlotte Dinger did come
                            to realize her dream, and so much more. The carousel pictured
                            here this web page, is the machine she did rebuild, own, and
                            operate.

                            The second experience came during a 1972 visit to the antique
                            store, where she encountered an old and faded carousel horse. For
                            all its neglect and disrepair it evoked a strong and powerful
                            nostalgic recollection of her bright childhood fascination, so she
                            paid $75 on the spot. After bringing the many pieces of the small
                            wooden horse home, she began stripping away the successive
                            layers of thick paint. The obscured delicate carved features soon
                            began to show. Her childhood fascination was well on the way to
                            becoming a full-blown adult obsession. Inspired by her initial
                            purchase, Mrs. Dinger soon tracked down what she realized was a
                            vast trove of discarded carousel art...
